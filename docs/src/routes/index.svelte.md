## Headless components

Headless components are unstyled, higher-order components that "orchestrate" provided content in a specific way. They typically consume other components (either through slots or props) and connect them in useful ways.

**Note:** If you templated this starter, you own these components. If you need a slightly different functionality or the current markup makes it difficult to apply a specific layout, don't be afraid to just directly edit an headless component. They're meant to give you a head start, no need to work around them. :)
