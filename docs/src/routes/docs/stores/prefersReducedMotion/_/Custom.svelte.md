Honouring a user's motion setting is especially relevant for javascript-controlled animations
(e.g. when using Svelte's built-in `spring`). If you use animations that rely on
javascript, please make sure to provide an alternative for users that prefer
reduced motion. (CSS-based animations are disabled by default when appropriate.)
