# Component library: [rbb-data/svelte-starter](https://github.com/rbb-data/svelte-starter)

This storybook documents the component library that comes with [rbb-data/svelte-starter](https://github.com/rbb-data/svelte-starter), a template project to create data visualizations with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

Since [rbb-data/svelte-starter](https://github.com/rbb-data/svelte-starter) is meant to be templated, the components documented here are usually copy-pasted into a project and thus serve as a starting point for an implementation (rather than a finalized solution).

Some components implement common UI patterns (folder "User interface"), others help to implement charts and data visualizations (folder "Visualization"). The folder "LayerCake" contains building blocks for charts. These are meant to be used with [LayerCake](https://layercake.graphics/) and [Friendly Charts](https://github.com/sophiamersmann/friendly-charts). [rbb-data/svelte-starter](https://github.com/rbb-data/svelte-starter) comes with few examples on how to use these components: https://github.com/rbb-data/svelte-starter/tree/main/src/routes/examples.
