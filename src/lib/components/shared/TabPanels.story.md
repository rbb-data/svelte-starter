`<Tabs />` and `<TabPanels />` work together to orchestrate horizontally
aligned tabs. This component controls the _tab panels_ (i.e. the content
that is associated with a tab).

**The rendered markup is composed of:**

- `.tabpanel`: wrapper element

**Note:** Must be used in conjunction with `<Tabs />`.
